✅ ISSUES RESOLVED:

1. ✅ Max Height Card Rack Fixed
   - Removed max-height limitations on rack cards when expanding sensor data
   - File: Frontend/app/dashboard-overview/components/containment-racks-tabs.tsx
   - Cards now expand fully without height constraints

2. ✅ Backend NuGet Deployment Error Fixed  
   - Root cause: NuGet looking for Windows path in Linux system
   - Solution: Added Linux-specific NuGet configuration in deploy.sh and update-prod.sh
   - Clear NuGet caches and set proper NUGET_PACKAGES environment
   - Create temporary nuget.config to override Windows fallback paths

3. ✅ PM2 Frontend Port Access Fixed
   - Issue: PM2 not properly binding to port 3000 
   - Solution: Enhanced PM2 configuration with ecosystem.config.js
   - Added proper hostname binding (0.0.0.0)
   - Added port accessibility verification
   - Better error handling and logging

4. ✅ Update Production Script Enhanced
   - Applied all deploy.sh improvements to update-prod.sh
   - Added fix_nuget_linux() function for NuGet consistency
   - Enhanced PM2 configuration with ecosystem.config.js
   - Added proper port verification and error handling
   - Both scripts now have consistent deployment logic

NEXT DEPLOYMENT STEPS:
1. For new deployment: sudo ./deploy.sh 
2. For production updates: sudo ./update-prod.sh
3. Both scripts will now:
   - Fix NuGet Linux configuration automatically
   - Create proper PM2 ecosystem config
   - Verify port 3000 accessibility
   - Handle all error scenarios properly

All issues from previous deployment have been resolved!
Both deploy.sh and update-prod.sh are now consistent and enhanced!
